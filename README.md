Three different passwords will be generated.

- Alphanumeric password with special characters
- Alphanumeric password
- Numeric password

Select the one you would like to use and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Password will be copied to the cipboard in a transient mode, which means,
that password will not be saved in the clipboard history.

Before selection, you can also press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> to additionally show the selected password using the Alfred Large Type.
